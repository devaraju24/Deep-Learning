Faster R-CNN using Detectron2 and SSD using MM Detection

Images are labelled and coco json files are created and feed as input to both the models

Faster R-CNN performed using Detectron2 and pre trained weights are used to train the model. 

SSD300 model was perfomred using MM Detction and pre trained weights are used to train the model.
